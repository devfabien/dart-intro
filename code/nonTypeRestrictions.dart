dynamic value = "true";
value = 100;
value = "devfabien";
print(value);

Object element = "true";
element = 100;
element = "devfabien";
print(element);

// both dynamic and Object are used to create variables that can hold any type of value.
// dynamic is more flexible than Object and is the preferred choice in modern Dart development.
